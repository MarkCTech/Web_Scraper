# Web_Scraper
## Summary
This was an exercise in using Requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape a website for data, as part of my Python coursework.  

The program takes in a URL and scrapes all pages until there is no 'Next Page' button available, then lists and prints all unique author names found.


 
 ## Using the program
 Use of this program is currently limited to the single example website I used to practice; https://quotes.toscrape.com/
